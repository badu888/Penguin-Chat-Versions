How to play:
To play Experimental Penguins Default and Football, press Play (flash function) on connecting to the server (cchat-048.swf/fpchat-080.swf to open)
Experimental Penguins 1.15 Demo doesn't require this (penguins-115-demo.swf to open)
To play Penguin Chat 2.11 and 3, use login, it's bypassed so no need to use password and register, also in 2.11 you can play as guest (chat.swf to open)
You will find how to play 2.04 (chat.swf to open)
Issues:
In Penguin Chat 2.04, you can't walk
